Converts true anomaly to Mean anomaly using the eccentric anomaly.

The true anomaly is an angular parameter that defines the position of a body moving
along a Keplerian orbit. It is the angle between the direction of periapsis and the
current position of the body, as seen from the main focus of the ellipse (the point
around which the object orbits).

Similarly, the  mean anomaly is a parameter that also defines the position of a
body that is moving in a Kepler orbit.
It is defined as the time since the last periapsis (closest approach
to the central body) times 2π / T, where T is the duration of a full orbit.
The mean anomaly increases uniformly from 0 to 2π radians during each orbit.

The mean anomaly M can be computed from the eccentric anomaly E by the formula

                        M = E - e \cdot \sin E

To find the position of the object in an elliptic Kepler orbit at a given time t,
the corresponding mean anomaly is determined and then the corresponding
eccentric anomaly is found by solving this equation numerically.
