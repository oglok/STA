 Patched by Guillermo on July  11th 2009 to comply with STA statevector defintions and treat special cases
 when eccentricity is bigger than zero or when the true anomly or the argument of the perigee are not well
 defined. This routine needs to be converted into equinoctial elements for v2.0

/* This function converts a state vector given in cartesian coordinates to an state vector given in

 Description:
      This function transforms spacecraft cartesian orbital elements in Keplerian
      orbital elements

 Input:
      mu standard gravitational parameter of the planet/moon
      x  x-coordinate in ECI system (km)
      y  y-coordinate in ECI system (km)
      z  z-coordinate in ECI system (km)
      xd vx-coordinate in ECI system (km/s)
      yd vy-coordinate in ECI system (km/s)
      zd vz-coordinate in ECI system (km/s)

 Output:
      a  semi-major axis (km)
      ec eccentricity (-)
      i inclination (rad)
      w0 argument of the perigee (rad)
      o0  right ascention of the ascending node (rad)
      m0 mean anomaly (rad)

 Example of call:


 Date: July 2009
 Version: 2.0
