STA uses interpolators based on the State Vector structures defined in "Astro-Core/statevector.h"
file. Vector and matrices operations are performed using the Eigen library.

Given a set of data points (x1 , y1 ) . . . (xn , yn ), the STA interpolators compute a
continuous interpolating function y(x) such that y(xi ) = yi

The interpolation is piecewise smooth, and its behavior at the end-points is determined by the
type of interpolation used.

/*
 Linear interpolation between two state vectors x0 and x1.
interval is the length of time (in seconds) between the two state vectors.
t is a value between 0 and 1 that specifies the time within the interval.

If the two known points are given by the coordinates (x_0,y_0)
and (x_1,y_1), the linear interpolant is the straight line
between these points. For a value x in the interval (x_0, x_1),
the value y along the straight line is given from the equation

    \frac{y - y_0}{x - x_0} = \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0}

Solving this equation for y, which is the unknown value at x, gives

    y = y_0 + (x-x_0)\frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1-x_0}

which is the formula for linear interpolation in the interval
(x_0,x_1). Outside this interval, the formula is identical
to linear extrapolation.
