//========================== STA library for global optimizers ==============================//*/


/* This header file defines the class that encapsulates STA global optimization algorithms.

 --> HOW TO USE THE CLASS GlobalOptimizers:
The user shall include in the code of the project the following files:

GlobalOptimizers.h

random.h
input.h
realinit.h
init.h
decode.h
ranking.h
rancon.h
dfit.h
select.h
crossover.h
uniformxr.h
realcross2.h
mut.h
realmut1.h
keepaliven.h

RunOptimizer.cpp
pso1D.cpp
dgmopso.cpp
nsga2.cpp

Moreover the user shall provide in other file(s) of the project the definition of the following two functions,
declared and briefly described in the class body below:

void GlobalOptimizers::InitializeOptimizer()
gsl_matrix* GlobalOptimizers::EvaluateModel(gsl_matrix*,int)


To run an optimization, the user shall then define an object of the class GlobalOptimizers (e.g. OPT) and call
the following two functions:

OPT.InitializeOptimizer();			//to initialize the optimizer
OPT.RunOptimizer(int);				//to run the optimizer.

//NOTE I: in RunOptimizer int determines the type of optimizer used for the run. The following optimizers are available:

0. PSO-1D (Particle Swarm Optimization - mono dimensional --> file pso1D.cpp):
                basic implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization method for single-objective problems. This can be used only
                if the parameter NOBJ has been defined as 1 in InitializeOptimizer(), otherwise the program cannot execute the
                optimization run (it's only for single objective optimization!) and returns an error.
                This algorithm is very fast and for single-objective optimization should definitely be preferred to the other two
                algorithms, that are specifically implemented for dealing with more than one objective and are therefore not
                efficient for a single objective run (even though they can be used for that as well).
                PSO 1D implements a simple constraint handling technique that is efficient in dealing with the constraints, but
                the user shall comply with the following requirements in the modeling of the constraints:
                - NCONS must be defined in InitializeOptimizer() as the number of constraints to be satisfied;
                - the function EvaluateModel() must return 0 if the constraint is satisfied and a negative number correspondant to
                        the constraint violation if the constraint is violated (see structure of output gsl matrix below)
                - in case NCONS>1 the different constraints should preferibly have comparable constraint violation values, meaning
                        that if two different constraints have the same "gravity" for the user they should also have comparable
                        values for the constraint violations returned by EvaluateModel(). In fact, since the optimizer aggregates the
                        different constraints violations in a penalty coefficient, if the values are of different orders of magnitude
                        the optimizer will tend to minimize the constraint violation of the constraint(s) of higher order of magnitude
                        and will hardly find solutions with low constraint violation on the other constraint(s).

1. NSGA-II (Non Dominated Sorting Genetic algorithm - II --> file nsga2.cpp):
                efficient elitist genetic algorithm developed by Prof.Deb of the Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory. This
                algorithm can deal both with single or multi-objective problems, but is more indicated for multi-objective problems.
                NSGA-II has a constant size archive of solutions and therefore always returns to the user the number of solutions
                that have been required though the parameter NsolPareto defined in InitializeOptimizer(); of course it is not
                guaranteed that all these solutions are non-dominated. Since the archive and the population coincide, this
                algorithm does not work well if NsolPareto is low (50<NsolPareto<200 is suggested).	Even though the constraint
                handling technique is different with respect to PSO-1D, the same requirements are imposed on the user.

2. DG-MOPSO (Double Grid - MultiObjective Particle Swarm Optimization --> file dgmopso.cpp):
                further development of the first proposed MOPSO algorithm. As NSGA-II, this algorithm can deal both with single
                or multi-objective problems, but is more indicated for multi-objective problems. DG-MOPSO has a variable size
                archive that collects only the non-dominated solutions found so far up to a maximum of NsolPareto solutions;
                it is not therefore guaranteed that all the requested NsolPareto solutions are returned to the user. Since the
                swarm size (number of particles (solutions) that are evaluated at each iteration) is NOT equal to the archive size,
                the algorithm does not need a high number of archive solutions to work well as for NSGA-II. However, even if the
                user does not need a high number of solutions it is preferable to keep NsolPareto>30 (for lower values the
                mechanisms that maintain the diversity of solutions usually do not work well). DG-MOPSO uses the same constraint
                handling technique of PSO-1D, therefore the same requirements are imposed on the user.

//NOTE II: NSGA-II or DG-MOPSO ?
While for single-objective problems the use of PSO-1D is strongly suggested, for multi-objective problems two alternatives
are given. In general, DG-MOPSO is a faster algorithm and is therefore suggested as first choice, but NSGA-II sometimes
gives better results in terms of uniformity of distribution of the solutions over the Pareto front. Moreover it is not
guaranteed that DG-MOPSO will converge faster than NSGA-II on all kinds of problems and for all the runs.
The stochastic aspect of the algorithms implies that each run has different results, unless the same random seed is used.
Therefore it is strongly raccommended, in order to have a good confidence in the optimality of the results found, to
perform at least 2 or 3 runs with different random seeds with DG-MOPSO as first choice, but also to verify the achieved
Pareto fronts with NSGA-II.

//NOTE III: ALGORITHMS PARAMETERS :
only few basic problem data and algorithms parameters shall be set up by the user in InitializeOptimizer(); most of the
algorithms parameters are instead fixed to the default values inside the related codes. The values of these parameters
can influence sensibly the behaviour of the algorithms, and if the user that wants to change them should manually modify
them in the following files:
PSO-1D --> pso1D.cpp, at the beginning of the pso1D() function
NSGA-II --> input.h, inside the body of the function input()
DG-MOPSO --> dgmopso.cpp, at the beginning of the dgmopso() function

//NOTE IV:
at the end of this file two test mathematical functions are reported, a single-objective function called Griewangk and a
bi-objective function called t1, so that the user can use them to test the behaviour of the optimization algorithms.
